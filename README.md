DeepAutonet: Self-driving Reconfigurable HPC System with Deep Reinforcement Learning

See [paper](https://www.osapublishing.org/abstract.cfm?uri=ACPC-2019-S3C.4)

We design and evaluate DeepAutonet, a self-driving reconfigurable network exploiting deep reinforcement learning. Simulation results show that DeepAutonet can adapt its topology automatically to different traffic conditions.

The env part (Simu1.2Test) was simulated using OMNeT++ simulator (based on C++), while the DeepRL agent (Testt2) using TensorFlow (Python).
